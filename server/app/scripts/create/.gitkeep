https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#create

create
This event occurs when a Git branch or tag is created.

To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Contents" repository permission.

Notes:

This event will not occur when more than three tags are created at once.
Payloads are capped at 25 MB. If an event generates a larger payload, GitHub will not deliver a payload for that webhook event. This may happen, for example, if many branches or tags are pushed at once. We suggest monitoring your payload size to ensure delivery.
